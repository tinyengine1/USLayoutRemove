# USLayoutRemove
A basic batch program that removes the US keyboard layout that some games (or programs) might add if you are using the english (US) language but have a different keyboard layout.

### How it works
The batch file uses the included .xml files to first add the layout if it's not on the list yet to then remove it completely with control panel.

## Why
For some time I had trouble having to add and remove the layout from my list when a game adds it. (It was very frequent.)
I was tired from doing it manually and wanted to either get rid of it completely or just automate it.
I couldn't find a solution to get rid of it completely but this works.

Perhaps you find a solution with this. Maybe.


#### Of course you can modify this to work with other layouts.
